## Requirement
python-3.6  
pytorch-1.8.1  
torchvision  
numpy  
tqdm  
cv2

## Usage
* Clone this repo into your workstation 
  git clone https://github.com/NuaaYH/AGNet.git
* The datasets used in this paper can be download from BaiduYun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lwnw99tq9Uu10rrsX0rivg  (code:u6st)  
* Set the project format as follows:  
  ./AGNet  
  ./Dataset  
* Create the folders in AGNet as shown below:  
  ./Outputs/pred/AGNet/EORSSD(or ORSSD)/Test  
  ./Checkpoints/trained
  
 ## training  
1. Comment out line 79 of run.py like #self.net.load_state_dict......  
2. Comment out line 171 of run.py like #run.test() and ensure that the run.train() statement is executable  
3. python run.py

## testing
1. Put the model weights in ./Checkpoints/trained and ensure that line 79 of run.py is executable  
2. Comment out line 170 of run.py like #run.train() and ensure that the run.test() statement is executable   
3. python run.py
